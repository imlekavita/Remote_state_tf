Remote state


rmstate: it keeps tf infrastructure
it stores in the file called terraform.tfstate

there is also backup of the previous state in terraform.tfstate backup
 when you execute terraform apply
a new terraform.tfstate and backup is written

rm changes hit terraform apply again,terraform will make changes to meet the correct remote state
 ex u teminate instance that is managed by terraform, after terraform apply it will be  started again.

you can tf state version control
for eg git

allows collaborate 


tf state can be saved backend functionality in terraform
default is local backend
include :
s3
consule

it allows for collboration, the remote  state will always be available for the whole team
 
two steps configure a remote state
1 add backend code to a.tf filr
2 run the initialization process




you can also store your state in s3:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "mybucket"
    key    = "terraform-myproject"
    region = "us-east-1"
  } 
}

data"terraform_remote_state" "aws_state" {
  backend "s3" 
config{
    bucket = "terraform-state"
    key    = "terraform_tfstate"
access_key =" "
secret_key=" "
    region = "us-east-1"
}
}
